          Conditioning (FRC&reg;) Certification and Kinstretch certification shortly after. She has made incredible leaps in her movement abilities in such a short time and through practicing the system on herself, she can now transfer that
          experience
          in her teachings and guide students to reach their own mobility goals. Kristina is well known in the movements community as Functional Range Systems Social Media Manager and assists around the globe at FRC and Kinstretch

            and his athletes on what it takes to maintain a healthy body but gain strength goals at the same time. His training sessions are geared heavily toward the FRC/ Kinstretch mindset and my athletes could not be more grateful. Kinstretch/FRC
            is something that we have implemented with our organization for a couple years now. Our athletes respond quite well to the system with some great results that have been quite noticeable on the ice. Our athletes look forward to Kinstretch

          <p>"Kristina Heimbecker trained me for 3 amazing months! She took me through Flow Within Training style sessions which completely changed my strength and balance. When I first started I warned Kristina that I couldn’t lift a laundry basket
            of clothing without throwing out my lower back. I warned her that my core was really weak and I was actually afraid to lift weights. I run 3km a few times a week, but I don’t have core strength or upper body strength. During our initial
            meeting she tested my strength, balance and physical abilities, and created a program to target my needs. Kristina was encouraging, patient and really positive. After a few months I couldn’t believe the transformation of my core strength
            and overall upper body strength. I highly recommend Kristina and I would train with her forever if she lived in my city!"</p>
